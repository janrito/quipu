# Quipu

Quipu is a simple [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in) backed session manager.

I have too many tabs open. I struggle to keep them organised. I want to have something that allows me to save some bookmarks for later, in groups, but that doesn't require me to invest my whole work day into curating them. I also want to have those sessions available in a quickly.

## Build

Install dependencies

```
$. npm i
```

Interactively build the extension

```
&. npm run watch
```

## Credits

Built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) & [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), the fantastic [Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/) typeface,
scaffolding with [browser-extension-template](https://github.com/fregante/browser-extension-template)

## License

Haven't decided yet, probably a very permissive one.
